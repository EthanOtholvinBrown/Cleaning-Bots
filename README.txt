This program will display a plotted representation of bots covering tiles in a room as a mock "cleaning". The user will decide 
How many tiles there are in the room and the number of bots to use for the covering. The user then has two choices:
A) Determine how much (%) of the room can be covered in a given time.
B) Determine how much time (s) it will take for the bots to cover a given percentage. 

NOTE:
At its current stage, the program is not able to display the plotting outside of the IDE environment. That is planned for later. 

NOTE 2:
The more tiles space there is to cover, the more computer resources will be needed to calculate the movement of the bots as the space is covered.
